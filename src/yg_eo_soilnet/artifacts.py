"""The canonical artifact tree, and the three writers that put things in it.

Every artifact in this project is staged in a temporary directory and uploaded to MLflow - there is
no on-disk results root, and this module does not introduce one. What it does introduce is a single
place that decides WHERE inside a run an artifact lands, because before it every writer hardcoded
its own ``artifact_path`` string and the two training families drifted apart:

* sklearn CV plots were logged with no ``artifact_path`` at all, so they sat at the run root while
  the matching CSVs went to ``cv_results/``;
* Lightning wrote ``eval_plots/`` and ``lightning_metadata/``, neither of which had a sklearn
  counterpart;
* fitted models went to ``models/{model_name}`` on one side and a bare ``{target}_{model_name}`` on
  the other.

The tree below is what both families write now::

    <run>/
      meta/          run_summary_<target>_<model>.json
      eval_results/  eval_results_<target>_<model>.csv, split_summary_<target>.json
      plots/         pred_obs_<target>_<model>.png, cv_val_curve_<target>_<model>.png
      explain/       shap_beeswarm_*.png, shap_bar_*.png, shap_values_*.parquet, shap_summary_*.json
      cv/            cv_results_<target>_<model>.csv        (sklearn only)
      checkpoints/   <best>.ckpt                            (Lightning only)

Fitted models are the one thing that does NOT live in this tree: MLflow 3 stores them as LoggedModels
under ``mlruns/<experiment>/models/``, addressed by name rather than by artifact path. Their shared
naming convention is :meth:`ArtifactLayout.logged_model_name`.

:data:`LEGACY_ARTIFACT_PATHS` maps each new location to the ones it replaced. Readers consult it so
that runs recorded before this change - of which there are many in ``mlruns/`` - still resolve.
Writers never use it.
