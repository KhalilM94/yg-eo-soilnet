"""SHAP explainability for both training families.

The two entry points the logger uses:

* :func:`build_shap_results` dispatches to the backend explainer and returns one
  :class:`~yg_eo_soilnet.explain.result.ShapResult` per MODEL OUTPUT;
* :func:`log_shap_artifacts` turns those into the ``explain/`` artifacts.

**Nothing in this package imports ``shap`` at module scope, and nothing outside it imports this
package at module scope.** ``shap`` pulls in numba and is slow to import, so a run with
``EXPLAIN_ENABLED: false`` must not pay for it - and, because the test suite runs with
``filterwarnings = ["error"]``, must not risk a warning from a library it never asked for.
``ChildRunLogger._shap_gate`` checks the switch before this module is imported;
``tests/test_explain_logging.py`` asserts ``"shap" not in sys.modules`` after a disabled run.
