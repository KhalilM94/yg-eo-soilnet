"""SHAP figures, following the project's plotting convention.

As in plot_utils and hpo.plots: build a Figure, tight_layout it, and RETURN it - callers save and
close (yg_eo_soilnet.artifacts.log_figure does both). When there is nothing to draw, hand back a
figure carrying a message rather than None, so a caller never has to branch on the return value.

``import shap`` stays inside the functions so the module is cheap to import with SHAP disabled.
